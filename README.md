# Belief Revision
Use the Propostion class to create logical sentences as objects.

The proposition should be written with the variables as uppercase letters (preferably singular) and the operation should be given in lowercase letter, with either "and", "or", "not", "if" or "iff". The operations/variables should be seperated with a space and set the paranthesis in the right spot.

Example of a valid proposition in the code:
"A or (not C and (B or A)) iff C"
